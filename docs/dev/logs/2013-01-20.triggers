An alternative / complementary approach to notifications: triggers (or actions?)

A type may support various actions by creating files in its subdirectory
"actions". Other types can trigger an action of a different type or object
by calling them (indirectly?):


if grep "__file/etc/nginx/conf.d/.*:copy" "$__notifications"; then

    # Call action from a type
    cdist trigger __nginx/reload
fi


Not sure whether this approach (calling "actions" of other types) is sane,
as nginx should probably better know if it should be restarted "itself".

Alternate approach:

__nginx_vhost www.some-domain.ch --custom << eof
some custom code for __nginx_vhost inclusion
eof

__nginx_vhost:

    manifest:
        # __nginx_vhost requires __nginx: creates directories

        require"$__object_name" __nginx --require-only
        
        # Do WE or __file ... depend on nginx?
        cdist require __nginx

        # Create file that contains the giving code
        __file /etc/nginx/conf.d/www.some-domain.ch

        require="__nginx" __file /etc/nginx/conf.d/www.some-domain.ch

__nginx:
    manifest:
        __package nginx --state present

        __file some-custom-files

    gencode-remote:
        if first_install or file changed:
